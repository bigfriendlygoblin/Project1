The TDS roe exam is almost impossible to solve within the given time frame. While the team might aim to develop certain skills in students, I would like you to consider this: having an exam that is nearly impossible to complete in the allotted time which is a statement by your side…"

This situation is causing CGPAs to drop significantly. I request the team to consider this issue. Either make this exam ungraded or reduce its weightage. This is a very serious issue, as many of us are struggling to maintain good CGPAs to progress to the degree level.\n\nThank you for your consideration."

(just by solving them properly)\nQ.3: What is the knowledge, using which I can solve all 17 questions within 30 minutes (without fluking & without socializing/chatting/asking (with) others)?"

Implicit learning.\n\nImplicit learning is “How much can they answer if woken up from sleep?”\nExplicit learning is “How much can they answer given time and Internet?”\n\nSome may know 10% implicitly. Some know 50%. They’ll answer those in a few seconds.\n\nSome, they can FIND out. with Google, StackOverflow, ChatGPT. That’s explicit learning. But it takes time.\n\nSome, they just CAN’T find out. Maybe the terminology is unclear. Maybe their skill set is different."

Hopefully not.\n\nI hope this is at the edge of the class’ competence. If multiple people answer all 17, I’ll suggest 20 Q in 30 m next time, or pick tougher questions.\n\n(This sounds harsh. Over time, though, I’ve come to value frank feedback over polite encouragement.)\n\nWhat knowledge helps solve it this fast? Practice.\n\n3 strategies help."

    "text": "What knowledge helps solve it this fast? Practice.\n\n3 strategies help.\n\nConsistent practice. Practice regularly. Pick problems just outside the edge of competence (fail 50% of the time).\nSocial learning. Observe experts & peers and internalize their strategies. We’re social animals and learn faster through mimicry.\nEmotional engagement. If we like it or enjoy it, we learn faster. Practicing on real-world problems or problems we enjoy solving, working with people we enjoy, helps."

Today, as a manager, I’d just hire someone to do it.\nYou may not be good at it. When I got a “D” in German, followed by a “D” in Japanese, I realized I’m just not mentally wired for human languages. It’d be too much effort to learn.\n\nThe RoE scores will give an idea of your implicit learning."
