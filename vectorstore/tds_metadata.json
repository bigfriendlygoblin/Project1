But still question remains the same why to put such a question in TDS course? But my specific doubt is to Qn. 337 All these things had been done in courses like mlt, mlf. If it was a completely numerical question and it is guaranteed that there can only be one answer so why to put that question in the form of Multiple Select Question i.e Multiple Answer could be correct"

    "text": "**Q8: What is ngrok and how does it work?**\n\n**A8:** ngrok creates a public URL that forwards requests to your locally running application. This allows anyone on the internet to access your application, even though it's running on your local machine. Your computer acts as a server. Note that ngrok only works while your local server is running. For a permanent solution, deploy to a platform like Vercel or Netlify.\n\n**Q9: What is a virtual environment and why is it useful?**"

This prevents conflicts between different project dependencies. Think of it like creating a separate section in a swimming pool for a child, where the depth is less than the main pool. You can install libraries (like Flask and Pandas) within the virtual environment without affecting your global Python packages.\n\n**Q10: What is the assignment?**"

The \"run\" endpoint receives a task description (in plain English), processes it, and creates output files. The \"read\" endpoint retrieves the contents of a specified file."

You create a Docker image containing your application and its dependencies. Anyone can then download and run the image regardless of their operating system. This is especially helpful for teams with different setups or when deploying to multiple clients.\n\n**Q11: What should I focus on for the GA3 project?**"
